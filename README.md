# Soc-Challenges
I am embarking on a 90-day SOC challenge, where I will be documenting detailed write-ups on each challenge I complete. This initiative was made possible by Rajneesh Gupta, the originator of these challenges. However, I am going beyond the outlined requirements by exploring additional aspects to deepen my understanding and enhance my skills in SOC operations and cybersecurity.
